Q01. Please name your answer file as “AnswersToReferenceDemo.txt.”
A01. The file has been named as advised.

Q02. Download and try to compile the file. 
     Why doesn't it compile? I'm not just looking for which line(s) have the problem, but rather 
     what is wrong with those line(s).
A02. The program does not compile because it declares a reference variable without initializing it.
     The line 55: "int& xr;" is invalid because it is a reference to nothing. C++ does not allow null references like JAVA,
     so the compiler throws an error. We can fix it by having "int& xr" refere an object or a value.

Q03. What is happening when onePlus() is called? 
     In other words, what exactly does the function receive as an argument? 
     Why isn't the value of the variable in main() altered?
A03. When onePlus() is called it recieves a copy of the argument.
     The contents of the onePlus() alter the copy only, not the variable in the main().


Q04. Conversely, consider the call to refIncrement(). 
     What is the argument here and why is the value of the variable in main() changed?
A04. 'a' here is a reference to the original variable. No copy is made here. a++ directly modifies the variable in main. The "int& a" 
     is the reason why this is all happening.

Q05. Finally, consider the code related to value(). First of all, make sure you understand what Pair is and what the declaration of pairs means.
A05. A Pair is a simple container that holds two values together. The two values can be of different types, and they can be stored as a single unit.
     The declaration of pais means that they behave like a key-value store.

Q06. Next, consider a call to value(). What does the function receive as an argument? What is the meaning of const in this context?
A06. The function recieves a reference to a string. It is not a copy of the string. The function cannot modify s, due to the "const" keyword.

Q07. What does value() return? How can it be legal and what does it mean to apply the ++operator to its return value?
A07. The function value() returns an integer reference (int&). The integer it is referring to is the val field of a Pair
     stored in the global vector pairs. It is legal because the returned refers to data that continues to exist after the function ends. 
     The vector pairs is global, so its elements are not destroyed when value() is returned. Since value() returnds a reference, it behaves like a 
     variable, the ++ operator increments the val associated with "aa".
